## Project Objective
Amazon was a pioneer in the use of robots in fulfillment centers. They are densely packed with a lot of shelves to optimize the space. The transporter robot needs to move a few shelves out of the way to get to its desired item for retrieval. This project aims to reduce average time for fetching an item by choosing the most optimal way for retrieval of a shelf in a fulfillment center with AS/RS by using transporter robots. A set of turtle bots are used in place of shelves in the gazebo world.


## Contributions
There are currently no Gazebo models related to this concept.The idea is similar to the “15 puzzle” game. We are going to move each shelf one by one to get to the desired item out of the pack by moving the least number of steps as possible. Each turtle bot moves one step at a time and creates space for the next bot to enter. 


## Project Plan
The textbook chapters 3, 4, 5 & 7 are applied in the project. The code related to 15 puzzle game can be found online.


## Milestones/Schedule Checklist
{What are the tasks that you need to complete?  Who is going to do them?  When will they be completed?}
- [x] Complete this proposal document.  *Due Nov. 2*
- [x] Import multiple turtlebots into Gazebo and place them inside a rectangular boundary. *Due Nov. 8*
- [x] Create Gazebo .launch file to run the 15 puzzle. *Due Nov. 12*
- [ ] Understand the 15 puzzle code & build the schematic for applying the code on turtlebots. *Due Nov. 18*
- [ ] Create progress report.  *Due Nov. 20*
- [ ] Apply the 15 puzzle logic to retrieve desired turtlebot from the rectangular boundary. *Due Nov. 26*
- [ ] Make a Gazebo world and code considering variable number of turtlebots rather than 15. *Due Nov. 30*
- [ ] Create final presentation.  *Due Dec. 4*
- [ ] Update documentation based on presentation feedback. *Due Dec. 7*
- [ ] Provide system documentation (README.md).  *Due Dec. 14*


## Measures of Success
- [ ] View turtlebots inside a boundary in Gazebo.
- [ ] Demonstrate that a single turtle bot can be pulled outside the boundary in step by step manner.
- [ ] Apply the 15 puzzle and retrieve the turtlebot using most optimal number of steps.
- [ ] Implement code on a model that can have variable(multiple) number of turtlebots.
- [ ] Have a classmate follow the steps in the README to successfully run the simulation without any help.
